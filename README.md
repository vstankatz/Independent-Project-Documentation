First Friday (2/28) Working on Independent Project:
8 - 9 : Read React Native Docs on getting started, and read all documentation for Expo under Getting Started and The Basics.
https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started.html
https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/

9 - 10 : Read doc on adding redux to react native, seems much easier to start with redux than to integrate it later on. Read React Native Docs Learn the basics through Handle Text Input. Started reading about react native navigation.
